# Implementation Details

I found this project buried in my archives from way back in 2019, when I didn't know how to use GitHub. So what better opportunity to upload and host it on the web than now?!

# Resources Used

* Videos of Dan Shiffman from ![The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) on this topic (Parts ![1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k) and ![2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZxUCWAjb0) and ![3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwRT4PCT6RU)). Super duper helpful in understanding what was going on, how the algorithm worked and how to structure the project.
